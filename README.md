# README
live version of the app @
https://wozane.herokuapp.com/

This app has been created so I have a place where I can show my crochet work.
As this is my first own project, I am sure it will change while using it.
The sections will most likely stay as they are now. For certain they will grow.
Main sections are ""GALLERY" & "BLOG". The first one is a place build on the
same idea as Pintrest. "BLOG" will be the place where I will share my completed
projects and the ones that are in progress. "SHOP" section is empty for the time
being as I need to make some stuff for sale. "ABOUT ME" is a static page, contact
details need to be added; e.g. facebook link, email address.
